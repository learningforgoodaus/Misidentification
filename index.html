                        <p>Here are some of the reasons and circumstances that pose as barriers for Aboriginal women and children: A lack of support to understand legal rights and how to access support – especially in remote communities, lack of cultural competency in the support sector, lack of access to communication or transport, fear of child removal if disclosing DFV, community driven pressure to discourage people from seeking outside support.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Signs Often Missed</h3>
                        <p>Frequent unexplained injuries from physical violence and hospital visits or crisis centers. Sudden or repeated displacement or homelessness, psychological distress – particularly among mothers who experienced conflict or family violence during pregnancy.</p>
                        <p>Isolation and reluctance to speak about what’s happening, or statements like “It’s just family business,” “We’ll handle it ourselves,” or “Don’t get outsiders involved.”</p>

Because of this there can be fear and distrust of authorities (because of experiences in their country of origin), there may be community norms that discourage telling anyone outside the cultural group about violence in relationships.</p>

Hearing discussions about plans for female genital mutilation or cutting. Reproductive coercion and forced or underage marriage. Religious abuse – justifying a reduction in their human rights with certain religious beliefs.</p>

                        <p>They may have unpaid bills, and lack of access to finances to purchase essential items like mobility aids, food and medication. Being left alone without food, medication, or support for extended periods. Some perpetrators may control when they can shower, who can visit or when they get to leave the house.</p>

                        <p>Some children and young people may be hesitant to speak up and report domestic and family violence as they are still young and may be perceived to be “making up stories”. While under legal parental care, they may fear the withdrawal of support for their basic need to be met (for example when abuse is perpetrated by a parent). Some may not be confident to express or communicate the abuse or not know who to trust or where to find services that can help them.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Signs Often Missed</h3>
                        <p>Risk taking behaviours and substance abuse from trying to deal with trauma. Running away or homelessness in an attempt to remove themselves from an unsafe environment. Unexplained injuries, cigarette burns or frequent complaints of pain from physical violence.</p>
                        <p>Signs of neglect may be poor hygiene over an extended period. Social signs of control or intimidation may be a lack of trust for adults or authority. A decline in academic effort, disrupted sleep and depression.</p>

                        <h3>Why They Slip Through the Net</h3>
                        <p>Men may face additional barriers to being recognised as victims because of stereotypes about masculinity or assumptions that they are more likely to be the person causing harm. They are often reluctant to disclose abuse, these reasons make it much harder for them to get the right help, protection, and support from police, courts, and other services.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Signs Often Missed</h3>
                        <p>Because people may not expect men to be victims, important indicators can be missed such as withdrawal from friends and family, sudden changes in behaviour, depression and suicidal thoughts. Visible or unexplained injuries, or heightened anxiety when communicating with a partner.</p>
                        <p>Coercive control, physical and emotional abuse, financial restriction, or threats to reputation can also be overlooked because they don’t fit common stereotypes of what victimisation “looks like.”</p>
